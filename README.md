cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## Environment Variables

This project uses Vite environment variables (`import.meta.env`).

- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Public anon key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` — Project identifier

> When using Lovable Cloud, these are auto-configured. Do not edit `.env` directly.

**Server-side (backend secrets, never exposed to the browser):**
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` — Used in the enrichment backend function for web scraping
